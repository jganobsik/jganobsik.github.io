During this past summer, I received some news that nobody wants to hear: The startup that I had been working for was shutting down. It was this unfortunate situation that led me to re-evaluate my career. I had been wearing many hats at my previous job, as many early employees at a startup do, but one of the most enjoyable aspects of this position was managing our team of offshore software developers, working with them to build our platform and ensure it meets our specifications. 

Blockchain development was a new yet growing field, and it looked like an interesting discipline to pursue. I enrolled in several online courses, including a certificate program from University of Buffalo. After completing these courses, I began learning python, particularly financial modeling. I have always enjoyed finance, particularly alogrithmic trading, which I practiced on Quantopian. Eventually, I decided a bootcamp was the best way to move forward with programming as a career. I am close to finishing my first project, a stock information CLI app that provides metrics for a given ticker. Once that is completed, I will upload a blog post on that app. 

I hope to cover a wide range of categories and themes with my projects, and showcase my interests and hobbies through them. I look forward to finding interesting applications of my programming knowledge through these projects!
