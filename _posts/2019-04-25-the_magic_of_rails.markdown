After working in Sinatra, Rails can seem like a developer's dream. After manually building each model and migration, connecting every route by hand, and spending countless hours searching for sinatra-specific content, building the basic infrastructure of a site is a breeze with Rails. This is exactly why Rails was created: To make life easier for programmers. I love the Rails community, which is full of helpful individuals addressing practically every issue, feature and implementation you can think of. A simple web search for almost any rails-related topic yields relevant, well written results, and sites such as Medium and Youtube are full of tutorials and examples of how to work with Rails. Hats off to the Rails community!
