Most of my professional experience to this point has been focused on IT and Entrepreneurship. I have had several IT Ops internships, including one at a startup that designed iPad cases, and obtained several IT-related certifications while pursuing a degree in business and entrepreneurship at Miami University. I greatly enjoyed my time working in IT Ops, especially when I was able to learn new skills and expand my knowledge of the various functions of IT. I also took several CS courses at Miami, including courses in Visual Basic and SQL. I wrote small programs for fun, and enjoyed automating simple tasks like assigning teams to participants in my dorm's video game tournaments.


After graduating from Miami University in 2016, I briefly worked at a small healthcare nonprofit building an inventory management and asset tracking before joining a startup. I managed our offshore software development, web presence, and promotional materials, and made minor contributions to the codebase. While I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and work variety that came with the job, I felt that this particular role was not intellectually stimulating. When that company, which started in India, shut down its US operations, I felt this was a perfect opportunity to try something different.

I began looking into Blockchain development this past summer, when demand was high for people specializing in this field. I took a few online courses on blockchain, including one offered by University of Buffalo. These courses confirmed my desire to pursue a software engineering role, but I quickly came to 2 realizations: first, the job market for ethereum developers was somewhat correlated to the price of ethereum, which has not been performing well as of late, and second, demand for developers who only knew niche languages like solidity was low, as most companies desired candidates who were familiar with popular frameworks like React and Rails. I decided that the best path for me was to become a full-stack developer, and began studying for admission to several top bootcamps. After reviewing my options, I felt Flatiron School was the best place for me to advance my passion for code and become a qualified software engineer. I am excited to see what the future holds as I continue learning about software development in 2019!
